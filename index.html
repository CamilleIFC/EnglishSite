            <h2>About This Site</h2>
            <p>Hey, welcome to my website! This is where I will be posting most, if not all, of my assignments this year. For now, you can find my picture for the photo competition, and my interview script. This page will be updated regularly as the year goes by, so feel free to tune in every once in a while to find some new stuff! This page was last updated on the cold, rainy evening of Tuesday, November 26.</p>

            <p>This is my entry for the photo competition. I hope you like it! What motivates me to study here is the direct link between ESTACA and the world of
                transportation; more specifically aviation. This photo is a representation of my goal to master
                and indulge in the world of aeronautics and meteorology.</p>

    <h2>Interview Script</h2>
    <p>Here’s the script I prepared for my interview project:</p>
    <div id="script-container">
        <p><u>What would you say is your greatest aviation-related achievement?</u></p>
        <p>
            Crossing the U.S. twice in a single-engine aircraft from West to East is my top achievement. The live
            improvisation required every hour, especially due to changing weather conditions, made the journey incredibly
            rewarding. On one trip, I adjusted my route southward after crossing the Rockies, anticipating that the
            northern path would become challenging in two days. It was a continuous exercise in time-sensitive
            problem-solving, which I loved.
        </p>

        <p><u>What role has aviation taken in your life?</u></p>
        <p>
            Aviation is central to my life. I work on a flight simulator, so there isn’t a day that goes by without
            thinking about aviation and related topics.
        </p>

        <p><u>How has the English language impacted your life and career?</u></p>
        <p>
            English has been foundational to everything I’ve done. It enabled me to learn coding, flying, secure an
            internship in the U.S., and eventually stay there. Most significantly, it was crucial for flying in the
            U.S. When I moved there, I earned my pilot’s license before even getting a California driver’s license. The
            biggest challenge during my checkout was understanding the fast-paced air traffic controllers in
            California.
        </p>

        <p><u>If you could make one change to the aviation/transport industry, what would it be?</u></p>
        <p>
            I’d push for more automation. Humans are fallible, and we should reduce reliance on intensive training to
            prevent accidents.
        </p>

        <p><u>Who are some people you aspire to and why?</u></p>
        <p>
            Elon Musk used to be one, though he’s become the worst version of himself. I admired his ability to identify
            flaws in systems and streamline them in ways others rarely considered. Beyond him, I deeply respect
            entrepreneurs. Turning an idea into a successful product or service requires incredible resilience, and I
            admire that journey.
        </p>

        <p><u>How did you get into aviation?</u></p>
        <p>
            Flight simulation was my entry point. Flying virtually every day made my actual training much faster and
            more intuitive.
        </p>

        <p><u>What's your favorite plane? Why?</u></p>
        <p>
            My favorite is the XCub, which I own. It’s a fast, powerful, and fun aircraft that never fails to leave me
            smiling after every landing.
