            <p>Hey, welcome to my website! This is where I will be posting most, if not all, of my assignments this year. For now, you can find my picture for the photo competition, and my interview script. This page will be updated regularly as the year goes by, so feel free to tune in every once in a while to find some new stuff! This page was last updated on the cold, rainy evening of Tuesday, November 26.</p>

            <p>This is my entry for the photo competition. I hope you like it! What motivates me to study here is the direct link between ESTACA and the world of
                transportation; more specifically aviation. This photo is a representation of my goal to master
                and indulge in the world of aeronautics and meteorology.</p>
